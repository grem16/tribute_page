              Charles Babbage (1791-1871) was an English mathematician and
              engineer who developed the first mechanical calculator. His
              intention was to make calculations more reliable, which were
              essential for different sectors of industry to avoid potentially
              fatal errors.

              He was one of the first scientists to have a rough idea of ​​what
              we know today as a computer.

              Towards the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th
              century, the development of mathematics was well established by
              scientists who left solid foundations for geometry, trigonometry,
              algebra, etc. However, the calculations were significantly tedious
              and complex to execute, which often led to errors.

              He then designed and built his mechanical calculator, capable of
              performing numerical functions using the difference method. He
              also designed, although he did not build, the analytical machine,
              with which, theoretically, computing or tabulation programs could
              be executed.He then designed and built his mechanical calculator,
